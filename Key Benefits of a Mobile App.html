                    Every church app is unique. But churches tend to use them
                    for the same handful of benefits. A good church website can
                    also provide most of these benefits, but no other solution
                    can match the accessibility of an app—one tap takes people
                    to everything they need, and apps have unique features that
                    drive engagement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here are 5 Key Benefits of a Mobile App for your church;
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    1. Increased church giving Gifts given through a mobile app
                    are higher on average than other online giving methods.
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    The average gift size through mobile app is about $176 and
                    churches normally see at least a 5% increase in gifts within
                    the first year alone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Every year, fewer and fewer people carry cash and checks.
                    But many churches still rely on passing the offering basket
                    to make ends meet. As trustworthy as your ushers are, most
                    people just aren’t comfortable passing around their credit
                    card or bank account information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Church apps provide a simple, secure way to give via
                    credit/debit card.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With an In-App giving option, a first-time giver can donate
                    to your church in seconds, and they can save their
                    information to give even faster next time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    50% of churches see a 75 percent increase in recurring
                    giving within their first year—which means a lot more giving
                    happens automatically.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even when churches have already used another digital giving
                    solution, switching to a church app increases giving.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Plus, a church app saves so much time for staff members who
                    have to sort through all the cash and checks every weekend,
                    and it speeds up the year-end tax process (if any). The time
                    your church’s financial team saves and the increase in
                    giving can make the app more than pay for itself.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    2. Increased communication with your members
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    One of the problems churches often experience is digital
                    drift. Between social media, email, and your church website,
                    it’s easy for digital communication to become disorganized
                    and unwieldy. People only get bits and pieces of information
                    unless they follow and subscribe to every communication
                    channel you have.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A church app centralizes and streamlines your digital
                    conversation. With a church app, people have a singular
                    place to learn about events, prayer requests, and other
                    pertinent information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And unlike the information on your website, your app isn’t
                    static. Your congregation can share their own prayer
                    requests, reserve their places at events, and interact with
                    your content in other ways. A church website is a library of
                    information. A church app is more like a community.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You might think that if your website has blog posts,
                    devotionals, sermons, videos, or social media, that meets
                    your church’s digital communication needs. But an app
                    provides more convenient access to that content than a
                    website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When people leave their homes, they bring three things:
                    Their wallet, their keys, and their phone (soon the phone
                    will negate the other two). The fact that people have their
                    phone with them wherever they are means that throughout
                    their day, they have more opportunities to catch up on the
                    sermons that they’ve missed. This will help them get beyond
                    a Sunday-only mentality and encourage them to stay engaged
                    all week long.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    3. Greater reach for your ministry
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Apps don’t just increase your engagement with your
                    congregation. A mobile app can make your church accessible
                    to people outside your church, too.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Here are just a few types of people an app equips you to
                    engage;
                  </p>
                  <ul>

                  <h4>
                    4. Elevated visibility
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    On the internet, your website is out of sight and out of
                    mind. Unless people need to visit it for a specific reason
                    or stumble upon it in a Google search, there’s no reason for
                    them to think about it. When they do want to visit your
                    site, they need to remember the URL, bookmark it, or search
                    for it. That’s not the case with an app.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Your church app lives on people’s phones, and it will stand
                    out. Even if it doesn’t get a coveted place on someone’s
                    home screen, it’s still visible every time they search their
                    apps, offering quick, one-click accessibility to your
                    church’s information and content. Not to mention, push
                    notifications mean people don’t have to open your app before
                    you can interact with them.

                    Data plays a vital role in helping churches make informed
                    decisions. But without an app, that data is often limited to
                    broad giving trends and a smattering of demographic
                    information. When you have to manually upload data, it’s
                    hard to organize it in a useful way.

                    The more advanced insights you want, the more time it takes
                    the person creating your spreadsheets. There’s also a lot of
                    data you’re simply not going to collect. A church app
                    automatically collects and organizes data about how people
                    interact with your app, which helps you choose the best ways
                    to engage your congregation.
